# Assignment 4

It is due Tuesday, the 30th of September, 2025

## Assignment 4-1 (15 points)

Implement a method that uses higher-order methods to find the sum of all even numbers in a functional list. You must use the `foritm` method from FnList to iterate through the list and apply a predicate to filter even numbers.

## Assignment 4-2 (15 points)

Implement a method that uses `iforitm` to find the index of the first occurrence of a given element in a functional list. If the element is not found, return -1.

## Assignment 4-3 (20 points)

Implement a method that uses `rforitm` (reverse foritm) to check if a functional list is a palindrome. A palindrome reads the same forwards and backwards.

## Assignment 4-4 (25 points)

Implement a method that uses `irforitm` to find all elements in a functional list that are greater than their index position. Return a new functional list containing only these elements.

## Assignment 4-5 (25 points)

Implement a method that uses higher-order methods to implement a simple calculator that can evaluate expressions stored in a functional list. The expressions will be in postfix notation (Reverse Polish Notation) using a stack data structure from MyLibrary.
