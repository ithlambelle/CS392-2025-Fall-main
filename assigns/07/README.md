# Assignment 7

It is due Tuesday, the 11th of November, 2025.

## Assignment 7-1 (10 points)

This one is for testing your solution to Assign04_02.
In libraries/Library/FnGtree/FnGtreeSUtil.java, there
BFirstEnumerate and DFirstEnumerate are implemented.
Please (very slightly) modify the code so that it uses
your implementation of MyDequeList (Assign04_02).

NB: If you need to make changes to your implementation
of MyDequeList, you must clearly state what changes are
made in a README file.

## Assignment 7-3 (50 points)

A description on Game-of-24 and an accompanying demo can be found by visiting the
following link:
https://github.com/xanadu-lang/xats2js/tree/master/docgen/P-Ground/githwxi/Game-of-24
Please give a high-level description in English as to how Game-of-24 can be solved
using either DFS or BFS. Your description should be given in a README file for this
assignment.
1. Please give a DFS-based implementation
according to your description that should directly use the DFirstEnumerate method.
2. Please give a BFS-based implementation
according to your description that should directly use the BFirstEnumerate method.
